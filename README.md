# Some Problems in Interview Assessments

Repo for solutions of some coding problems I was encountering during interview assessments;

Feel free to push for more effective solutions, or include more problems;

More legit testcases on the go;

Subfolder structure for each problem shall be:

```Markdown

    interview_assessments/
    ├── README.md
    ├── .gitignore
    └── folder_problem_name/
        ├── testcase_script, with assessertion
        ├── implementation_script, includes solution
        └── problem_name.md, includes statements and inspirations

```
